# Project 4 - *Twitter Part 1*

**Twitter Part 1** is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets using the [Twitter API](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: **18-20** hours spent in total.

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can sign in using OAuth login flow
- [x] User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
- [x] The current signed in user will be persisted across restarts
- [x] In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, and timestamp.
- [x] Retweeting and favoriting should increment the retweet and favorite count.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the feed using infinite loading similar to the actual Twitter client.
- [x] User should be able to unretweet and unfavorite and should decrement the retweet and favorite count.
- [x] User can pull to refresh.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Image media files that are posted as part of the tweet (if any) are also shown along with text to enhance user experience!
- [x] If an image is a retweet, the name of the retweeter appears on the top and the data of the actual tweet appears in the body as in the actual Twitter app.
- [x] UIAlertController used to display and handle events related to logout, retweet, and unretweet.
- [x] Animations and Gradient Colors added to make the look and feel of **Twitter** more desirable.
- [x] App Icons and Launch Screen images added to enhance user's initial interaction with the app.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Auto-Layout anytime!
2. Animations related to images and buttons.

## Notes

Getting used to the Twitter API was a bit tough at first but hours spend to get used to it paid off at the end.
